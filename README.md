# Kodarch

**Kodarch** is a lightweight software development environment focused on clarity, automation, and modular design.  
It’s built to help developers move from concept to structure fast — without unnecessary complexity or bloat.

## Overview

Kodarch provides tools for building, organizing, and maintaining codebases with a focus on:
- **Speed** — minimal setup, instant workspace readiness.
- **Structure** — clear project architecture and dependency mapping.
- **Automation** — built-in processes for code generation, testing, and deployment.

The goal is simple: make software creation more systematic without slowing creativity.

## Features

- Rapid project setup and code scaffolding.
- Configurable templates for common architectures.
- Built-in version tracking and structure analysis.
- Lightweight CLI and API for automation tasks.
- Works smoothly with Bolt-hosted environments.

## Philosophy

Kodarch isn’t trying to reinvent frameworks — it’s here to **organize** them.  
Think of it as a coder’s architecture assistant: it sets the stage so you can focus on what actually matters — logic, flow, and innovation.

## Status

Actively being developed under **Foolibre Labs**.  
Early builds are experimental and evolving quickly.
